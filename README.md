## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Turned out to be relatively easy and I tackled this quite quickly. The biggest challenge for me was again positioning the images, especially in the main part. But with help of CSS grid it turned out to be quite easy.
